*This repo is on building, use it at your own risk.*

* An Expected Emacs Setup for MacOS
- Default with shortcuts and features that you already learned.
- Has an expected vim emulator via [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil-mode]].
- Provides tools like [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] and [[https://magit.vc/][magit]].
- Highly customizable.
- It's just an Text Editor, not an IDE(I use [[https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/][IDEA]]).
- Do not expected too much, and you'll be happy.

So this is the ultimate Text Editor for lifetime, if it looks good to you, welcome aboard.

* Checklist
- Emacs 26.3
- You'd better learn Vim before trying this.
